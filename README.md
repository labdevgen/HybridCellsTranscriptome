# HybridCellsTranscriptome
Welcome to the HybridCellsTranscriptome wiki!<br>
The Project is a supplement to the Matveeva, Fishman et al., 2017 paper (Nature Scientific Reports). 
It contains 3 scripts. 
clink.py and tophat.py were used to simplify execution of Tophat and Cufflinks on cluster nodes. 
analyzer.py is a simple python script to allow analysis of cuffdiff output. It needs gene_exp.diff and genes.fpkm_tracking files located in a script's folder. These files are part if cuffdiff output. The script has several “hard-wired” constants, and was designed for a sole purpose of analysing data from Matveeva, Fishman et al., 2017. 
All code was written by Veniamin Fishman. If you have any qustions related to the code, please write to "ur.ay ta f-ajnim" (reverse to get e-mail address).
