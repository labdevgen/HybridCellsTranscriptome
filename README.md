# HybridCellsTranscriptome
Welcome to the HybridCellsTranscriptome wiki!<br>
The Project is a supplement to the Matveeva, Fishman et al., 2017 paper (Nature Scientific Reports).<br>
It contains 3 scripts.<br>
<b>clink.py and tophat.py</b> were used to simplify execution of Tophat and Cufflinks on cluster nodes. <br>
<b>analyzer.py</b> is a simple python script to allow analysis of cuffdiff output. It needs gene_exp.diff and genes.fpkm_tracking files located in a script's folder. These files are part of cuffdiff output. The script has several “hard-wired” constants, and was designed for a sole purpose of analysing data from Matveeva, Fishman et al., 2017. <br>
<i>All code was written by Veniamin Fishman. If you have any qustions related to the code, please write to "ur.ay ta f-ajnim" (reverse to get e-mail address).</i>
